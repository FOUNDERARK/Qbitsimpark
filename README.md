# Quantum Computing Explorations

Welcome to the Quantum Computing Explorations repository! Here, we dive deep into the world of quantum computing, providing algorithms, simulations, educational resources, and tools for both beginners and advanced learners in quantum computing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you'll need:

- **Python 3.7+**: Most of the code here uses Python due to its extensive libraries for quantum computing like Qiskit, Cirq, or PennyLane.
- **Qiskit, Cirq, or PennyLane**: Install these libraries if you want to run or modify the quantum computing code.

### Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:founderark/quantum-computing-explorations.git
cd quantum-computing-explorations
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming you have a requirements.txt with necessary libraries
